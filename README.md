# mastersthesis

This is the master git repo for my master's thesis at Dartmouth College. the temporary title is "Personal approaches to electronic music hardware"

if, for some reason, you'd like to recompile the pdf from the LaTeX master, just clone the repo to your desktop 
open your favorite latex compiler (I use textmate and the LaTeX / BibTeX bundles). 

compile main.tex
run bibtex
create index
compile main.tex (twice)

this should clean up any bib / index glitches from the first compile
